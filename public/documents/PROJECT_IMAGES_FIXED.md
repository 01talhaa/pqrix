# Project Image Display - Fixed âœ…

**Date:** October 19, 2025

## Issue
Project images were not showing in:
- Homepage project cards
- Project detail page main image

## Root Cause
Code checked for `project.image` but projects use `images[]` array.

## Solution
Added fallback chain:
```tsx
project.image || project.images?.[0] || "/placeholder.svg"
```

## Files Modified
1. âœ… `components/projects-section.tsx` - Homepage cards
2. âœ… `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx` - Detail page + metadata

## Gallery Logic
- Shows only if `images.length > 1`
- Uses `.slice(1)` to skip first image
- First image = main display
- Rest = gallery

## Result
âœ… Single image â†’ Shows as main display, no gallery  
âœ… Multiple images â†’ First as main, rest in gallery  
âœ… Legacy `image` field â†’ Works correctly  
âœ… No images â†’ Shows placeholder  

**Status: Complete and working!** ðŸŽ‰
