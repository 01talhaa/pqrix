<h2>Introduction to 3D on the Web</h2>
<p>The web is no longer just flat pages and buttons. With modern technologies like Three.js and WebGL, you can create immersive 3D experiences right in the browser.</p>

<h3>Why 3D Web?</h3>

<h3>Getting Started with Three.js</h3>
<p>Three.js is the most popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser. Here's a simple example:</p>

<pre><code>
import * as THREE from 'three';

const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight);
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);

scene.add(cube);
camera.position.z = 5;

function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
  cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}

animate();
</code></pre>
