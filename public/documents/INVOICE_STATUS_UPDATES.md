- ✅ Only shows for milestone-based invoices (services with multiple steps)

- ✅ Displays all milestones with their payment status
- ✅ Grid layout showing which milestones are paid/unpaid

### 3. **Client Invoice Page Updates**

- ✅ Live status indicator with pulse animation

- ✅ Payment history updates automatically

### 4. **Workflow Improvements**

#### Admin Workflow (Example: 4-Step Service)
```
1. Admin sees invoice with 4 milestones (all unpaid)
   Milestones: [1:○] [2:○] [3:○] [4:○]

2. Admin records payment for Step 1
   - Selects "1. Step 1" from dropdown
   - Enters amount, method, transaction ID
   - Clicks "Record Payment"

3. System updates immediately:
   ✅ Invoice list refreshes
   ✅ Milestone badges update: [1:✓] [2:○] [3:○] [4:○]
   ✅ Status remains "Partial" (not fully paid)
   ✅ Paid amount increases
   ✅ Remaining amount decreases

4. Admin records payment for Step 2
   - Step 1 is now disabled (already paid)
   - Selects "2. Step 2"
   - Records payment

5. System updates:
   ✅ Milestones: [1:✓] [2:✓] [3:○] [4:○]
   ✅ Progress bar updates

... continues until all milestones paid

6. After last milestone:
   ✅ Status changes to "Paid"
   ✅ All milestones: [1:✓] [2:✓] [3:✓] [4:✓]
   ✅ Booking status updates to "Paid"
```

#### Client View (Same 4-Step Service)
```
1. Client opens invoice:
   Shows: "0 / 4 Milestones Paid"
   Status: Unpaid

2. After admin records Step 1 payment:
   (Auto-refreshes within 30 seconds)
   Shows: "1 / 4 Milestones Paid"
   Milestone 1: ✓ Paid (green badge)
   Milestone 2-4: Unpaid (gray)

3. Client can click refresh button for instant update

4. After all payments:
   Shows: "4 / 4 Milestones Paid"
   Status: Paid (green)
   All milestones marked as paid
```
